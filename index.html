          own village using the resources gained from attacking other player's
          villages with troops; earning rewards, buying them with medals or by
          producing them at their own village. The main resources are gold,
          elixir and dark elixir. Players can conjoin to create clans, groups of
          up to fifty people, who can then participate in Clan Wars together,
          donate and receive troops, and chat with each other.
