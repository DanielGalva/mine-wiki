      <img src="./public/clash-of-clans-logo.png" alt="Clash of Clans" />
      <p>
        The game is set in a fantasy-themed persistent world where the player
        is a chief of a village. Clash of Clans tasks players to build their
        own village using the resources gained from attacking other player's
        villages with troops; earning rewards, buying them with medals or by
        producing them at their own village. The main resources are gold,
        elixir and dark elixir. Players can conjoin to create clans, groups of
        up to fifty people, who can then participate in Clan Wars together,
        donate and receive troops, and chat with each other.

      <h3>2ยบ Garry's Mod</h3>

      <p>
        Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. There aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you
        to play.
        You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a
        catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. You can do it offline, or join the
        thousands
        of players who play online each day.
        If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions.
        But if you want to do more, we have the means.
